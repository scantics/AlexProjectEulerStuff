This is an (admittedly unorganized) collection of Python sripts that I've written over my college years to solve project Euler problems. Their differing levels of elegance reflect the progress of my programming ability over the years.

When I find time outside of more challenging projects, I will better organize and refactor most of them. In the meantime, let them demonstrate the interest I held, and continue to hold, in developing my problem-solving and programming skills outside of class.
